## Simple AES Generator

A simple lab we had for a class that dealt with AES encryption. It was not required to make a python script but just to encrypt and decrypt messages with AES. Instead of just using the simple web app I decided to quickly make a quick script by having AI get me the dependencies I needed and building a set of basic functions. I then wrote a loop to run the functions in a very minimalistic CLI program.
